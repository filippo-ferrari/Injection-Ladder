This is a simple Python script designed to be used with the IntelliJ IDEA plugin "File Watchers." It enables you to sort injected fields in ascending order based on character length when saving or editing a file.

If you rolled a chaotic evil character, you can also choose to sort the fields in descending order of character length it's up to you:

<code>autowired_fields.sort(key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True)</code>

That's it.
